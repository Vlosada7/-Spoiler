This is "No spoilers", a social media for television shows that allows you to chat with other users about the latest developments in the show, share your opinions about episodes, and keep up with new releases.

You can log in through your Gmail or simply follow the step-by-step registration process.

Here we have the main page where we can see the TV shows we want to follow, but for now it's empty. 
If you don't have any shows to watch, you can click on "Discovery" and it will show the most popular shows worldwide at the moment.

If the user wants to filter by category to find new shows, they just need to click here and select the category, and again, a list of the most popular shows will appear.

If the user is looking for a specific show, they just need to click the search button and type in their favorite show ("Search for How I Met Your Mother"), and save it to their "home".

On the show card, we can see the seasons (click on the seasons), the number of episodes in each season, as well as a card about the specific episode and its overall user rating.

If we go back to the show card, we can see the reviews made by other users to decide if we want to watch it or not.

Then, when we go back to the home page, our favorite shows will already be here.
